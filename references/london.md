# London — FCA National Storage Mechanism (NSM)

Primary source: the **FCA's National Storage Mechanism** (`data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism`), the UK's official repository for regulated information filed by LSE-listed issuers. RNS is the news wire; the NSM holds the documents.

## Ticker format

London tickers are alphabetic, up to ~4 letters (AZN, HSBA, NXT, SHEL), suffixed `.L` on most data platforms. The NSM is searched by **company name**, not ticker — resolve the name first (a quick web search if unsure).

## Script (needs real network access to api.data.fca.org.uk)

```
python scripts/fetch_uk_filings.py "AstraZeneca"                 # recent NSM documents
python scripts/fetch_uk_filings.py "AstraZeneca" --grep annual   # filter titles
python scripts/fetch_uk_filings.py "AstraZeneca" --include-rns   # include RNS announcement pages
python scripts/fetch_uk_filings.py "Next" --limit 5 --save-dir ./filings
```

Mechanics, verified live (2026-07, AstraZeneca):

1. `POST https://api.data.fca.org.uk/search?index=fca-nsm-searchdata` with JSON `{"from":0,"size":100,"sort":"publication_date","sortorder":"desc","keyword":"<company>","criteriaObj":{"criteria":[],"dateCriteria":[]}}` — an Elasticsearch-style response; each hit's `_source` has `company`, `headline`, `publication_date`, `download_link`, `source`.
2. Documents download from `https://data.fca.org.uk/artefacts/<download_link>` (supports Range requests). Raw byte saves.

**What didn't work, so don't re-try it:** structured `criteriaObj.criteria` filters with guessed field names (`company`, `issuer_name`, `classifications`) silently return zero hits. Use `keyword` + client-side filtering. Also note headlines are typed by filers and contain real typos ("2025 **Annul** Report" — AstraZeneca's actual filing headline), so prefer loose `--grep` terms like `20-F` or `annual` and be ready to eyeball the list.

## ESEF: modern UK annual reports are ZIPs, not PDFs

Since the UK ESEF mandate, the officially filed annual report is an **ESEF package** — a `.zip` containing the xHTML/iXBRL report (`reports/*.html`) plus taxonomy files. The zip is the authoritative filing; save it as-is. It won't open in a PDF viewer — to let the user read it, extract `reports/*.html` and open that, or fetch the glossy PDF from the company's own IR site (secondary source; say so). Older filings, circulars, prospectuses, and AGM documents are ordinary PDFs.

## Dual listings

Many FTSE issuers are cross-listed: US ADRs with SEC filings (AZN, HSBA=HSBC, BP, SHEL...), or dual primaries (RIO with ASX). Apply SKILL.md's dual-listing rule — ask, defaulting to all after ~15 seconds. A US-ADR 20-F on EDGAR is often the most convenient single English document and renders to PDF.

## Fallback

Browse the NSM portal manually or `web_search "<company> annual report NSM"`. In claude.ai's sandbox the API host isn't reachable — hand over the portal URL.
